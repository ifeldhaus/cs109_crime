<h2 id="#Problem">1 Problem Statement and Motivation</h2>

<p>According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), violent crime has increased 2.6% since 2012 with 1.2 million violent crimes in 2016 [1]. Predicting violent crime can be critical to effective targeting of prevention efforts given inevitable resource constraints. The objective of this analysis is to build and evaluate a data-driven model for predicting violent crime per capita in selected metropolitan regions of the U.S. using publicly available crime and census data from 2006 to 2016.</p>

<h2 id="#LitReview">2 Literature Review</h2>

<p>The connection between crime and city size has long been recognized. Several studies since 1976 discuss the tendency for larger urban areas to have higher crime rates. This relationship is hypothesized to be driven by overcrowding and anti-social behavior, an association between population density and poverty, and/or increased opportunity for crimes in densely populated areas [2,3]. Glaeser and Sacerdote (1999) use victimization data, evidence on criminal behavior, and crime reports to demonstrate a positive correlation between city size and crime rates per capita, including murder rates per capita [2]. Their findings suggest that higher pecuniary returns to crime and lower probability of arrest in urban areas are among the drivers of increased violent crime rates. Other studies point to the characteristics of inhabitants within a geographical area, including income, race, homeownership, and family structure as well as psychological and physical-environmental factors as predictors of crime [4–8]. Another study found that gun violence is spread through individuals’ social networks, as if an epidemic-like process of social contagion [9]. The factors considered in these studies are all distinctly related by urban geographical area.</p>

<p>A number of modeling techniques have been applied in the study of violent crime. Glaeser and Sacerdote (1999) employed a decomposition model, while Christens and Speer (2005) built a hierarchical regression model of inhabitant characteristics and population density [2,3]. Green, Horel, and Papachristos (2017) conducted an epidemiological analysis of social networks to explore the phenomenon of social contagion for gun violence. Each of these analyses highlight different aspects of violent crime and its connection with population density and/or city size. However, few studies explored how we can utilize these findings to predict violent crime rate in a given city.</p>

<p>Based on these existing evidences, we were particularly interested in population size and region as they relate to violent crime per capita in this analysis. We have also considered characteristics of inhabitants, such as median age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and poverty status, as each of these variables also align with the literature as potentially good predictors of violent crime [11].</p>

<h2 id="#Intro">3 Description of the Data</h2>

<p>Our goal is to build and evaluate a prediction model for violent crime per capita because the cost of violent crime to victims and the criminal justice system is significantly higher than other crime[10]. Thus, it is important to understand and be able to predict violent crime rate given census data and other crime data for a particular metropolitan area so that potential interventions may be designed for high violent crime cities.</p>

<p>Data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) of the FBI and U.S. Census Bureau between 2006 and 2016 were used to obtain information on our outcome of interest, violent crime, and potential predictors. Violent crime is defined by UCR as murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In our analysis, we obtained the log of violent crime as a rate per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>Potential predictors of violent crime included property crime (data available via UCR database), MSA population size, age, sex, race, ethnicity, household type, marital status, education attainment, place of birth and/or citizenship status, employment status, income in the past 12 months, type of income, homeownership, and poverty status, all of which are available and downloaded from U.S. Census dataset.</p>

<h3 id=#FBIdata>3.1 FBI Crime Dataset</h3>

<p>The FBI crime dataset had 3806 observations over the eleven-year time period (2006-2016) across 511 MSAs. 163 MSAs had data over all 11 years, and the majority (n=415) had data for 5 or more years. Due the large number of MSA, we grouped MSA into eight regions to visualize the geographic variability in crime rate: “New England”, “Middle Atlantic”, “East North Central”, “West North Central”, “South Atlantic”, “East South Central”, “Mountain”, and “Pacific” (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 1 above, violent crime varies dramatically across region. West South Central has the highest violent crime rate (501.43 violent crimes/100,000 people) while the Middle Atlantic has the lowest violent crime rate (275.05 violent crimes/100,000 people). This suggests that region may be predictive of violent crime, so region was included as a possible predictor in analyses.</p>
